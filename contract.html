        <h2>Contract</h2>
		I, <a href="introduction.html"> Laura Rios </a>agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2022, WEB115-N801, Web Markup & Scripting with my instructor, professor D.I. von Briesen.
		<br>		
		I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, 
		or that I wish to keep private.
		<br>
		I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
		<br>
        Signed: Laura Rios, 08/28/2022

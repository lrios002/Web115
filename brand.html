		<strong>Colors:</strong> I choose my palette color of the software <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com">http://colorschemedesigner.com</a> 
		It has one main color and four subcolors and I will play with two palletes:orange-coral and greys.
		<br>
		These palettes represent our favorite colors Coral and Grey and we will use them as background, letters,links,etc. 
		They symbolize our pesonality and harmony. 
		See Below palette color.
